# Conrad Sidebar example

Download the example [or clone the repo](https://github.com/voucherifyio/conrad-chrome-sidebar):


Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

For development, you need to load it as an unpacked extension.


For production, [publish to the Chrome Web Store](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish). You can keep the extension unlisted (no one can search for it) or [private](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2663860?hl=en) (people have to be added to a Google group to see it).
